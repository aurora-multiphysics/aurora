[!ac](MOOSE) is a command-line driven application. This is typical for a high-performance software
that is designed to run across several nodes of a cluster system. As such, all of the usage
of the software is through any standard terminal program generally available on all supported
operating systems. Similarly, for the purpose of interacting through the software, there is only
a single user, &quot;the user&quot;, which interacts with the software through the command-line. MOOSE does
not maintain any back-end database or interact with any system daemons. It is a executable,
which may be launched from the command line and writes out various result files as it runs.

Since [!ac](MOOSE) is a command-line driven application, all functionality provided in the framework
is operated through the use of standard UNIX command line flags and the extendable MOOSE input file.
The framework is completely extendable so individual design pages should be consulted for specific
behaviors of each user-defined object.

- +Framework Developers+: These are the core developers of the framework. They will be responsible
  for following and enforcing the appropriate software development standards. They will be
  responsible for designing, implementing and maintaining the software.

- +Developers+: A Scientist or Engineer that utilizes the framework to build his or her own
  application. This user will typically have a background in modeling and simulation techniques
  and/or numerical analysis but may only have a limited skill-set when it comes to object-oriented
  coding and the C++ language. This is our primary focus group.  In many cases these developers will
  be encouraged to give their code back to the framework maintainers.

- +Analysts+: These are users that will run the code and perform various analysis on the simulations
  they perform.  These users may interact with developers of the system requesting new features and
  reporting bugs found and will typically make heavy use of the input file format.

  technical lead will determine the severity and priority of all reported issues and assign resources
  at his or her discretion to resolve identified issues.
- The software maintainers will entertain all proposed changes to the system in a timely manner

!template! item key=system-modes
!! system-modes-begin
[!ac](MOOSE) applications normally run in normal execution  mode when an input file is supplied. However
there are a few other modes that can be triggered with various command line flags as indicated here:

| Command Line Flag | Description of mode |
| :- | :- |
| `-i &lt;input_file&gt;` | Normal execution mode |
| `--split-mesh &lt;splits&gt;` | Read the mesh block splitting the mesh into two or more pieces for use in a subsequent run |
| `--use-split` | (inplies -i flag) Execute the the simulation but use pre-split mesh files instead of the mesh from the input file |
| `--yaml` | Output all object descriptions and available parameters in YAML format |
| `--json` | Output all object descriptions and available parameters in JSON format |
| `--syntax` | Output all registered syntax |
| `--registry` | Output all known objects and actions |
| `--registry-hit` | Output all known objects and actions in HIT format |
| `--mesh-only` (implies -i flag) | Run only the mesh related tasks and output the final mesh that would be used for the simulation |
| `--start-in-debugger &lt;debugger&gt;` | Start the simulation attached to the supplied debugger |

!alert note
The list of system-modes may not be extensive as the system is designed to be extendable to end-user applications.
The complete list of command line options for applications can be obtained by running the executable with
zero arguments. See the [command line usage](command_line_usage.md optional=True).

[!ac](MOOSE)-based development follows various agile methods. The system is continuously built and deployed in
a piecemeal fashion since objects within the system are more or less independent. Every new object requires a test,
which in turn requires an associated requirement and design description. Some [!ac](MOOSE)-based development
teams follow the [!ac](NQA-1) standards.

No special requirements are needed for packaging or shipping any media containing [!ac](MOOSE) source code. However,
